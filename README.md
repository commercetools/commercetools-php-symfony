## Pre-requisites
Composer :
To install the composer go to https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

## Installation
You can either create a new Symfony project or use an existing Symfony project (ver. 3.4 and above)

Create a new Symfony project using the following command: 

```sh
composer create-project symfony/skeleton <project-name>
```

Next, navigate to the project's directory and run the following command: 

```sh
composer config extra.symfony.allow-contrib true
```

This automates most of the configuration using the `recipes-contrib` bundle from Symfony Flex.

Next, install the commercetools Symfony bundle. To do this, run the following from the command line
```sh
composer require commercetools/symfony-bundle
```

Alternatively, open the **composer.json** file, add `"commercetools/symfony-bundle"` to the `require` attribute, and run
```sh
composer install
```

Next, open the`.env` file or create a `.env.local` file on root directory and edit the following 
lines to add your credentials. You can retrieve your API client credentials from the Merchant Center under
`Commercetools Merchant Center > Settings > Developer Settings`, when you create a new 
API Client. Note that for security reasons you cannot retrieve the `CTP_CLIENT_SECRET` 
for clients created in the past.

```dotenv
CTP_CLIENT_ID=<your client id>
CTP_CLIENT_SECRET=<your client secret>
CTP_PROJECT_KEY=<your project id>
CTP_AUTH_URL=https://auth.commercetools.com
CTP_API_URL=https://api.commercetools.com
CTP_SCOPES=<your desired scopes>
```

or for US region change URLs to

```dotenv
CTP_AUTH_URL=https://auth.commercetools.co
CTP_API_URL=https://api.commercetools.co
```

For more information about using `.env` and `.env.local`, see
[here](https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration/dot-env-changes.html) and
[here](https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-4-2-define-env-vars-per-environment)

### Verify configuration

To verify that your configuration works, after adding your client credentials on the `.env` file
run the following on the command line:
```sh
bin/console commercetools:project-info
```
If everything is set up correctly, this should return
the details of your project. For example:

```
Project's key: super-cool-project-4
Project's name: my eshop at commercetools
Countries: DE, US
Currencies: EUR
Languages: en
Created at: 2019-02-04T11:28:49+00:00
Messages: disabled
```


## Usage

The commercetools Symfony bundle consists of 8 smaller bundles (The dependencies mentioned are
only the additional ones, required for bundle-specific functionalities)

- CartBundle
- CatalogBundle
- CtpBundle
- CustomerBundle
    - Dependency: `symfony/security-bundle`
- ReviewBundle
- SetupBundle
    - Dependency: `symfony/console`
- ShoppingListBundle
- StateBundle
    - Dependency: `symfony/console`, `symfony/workflow`, `twig/extensions`
    

By default, `CtpBundle` & `CustomerBundle` are enabled for all environments.
`SetupBundle` & `StateBundle` are only enabled for for development environments. To
see which bundles are enabled and optionally enable or disable them, edit
the `config/bundles.php` file.


### Available services

The main idea is that in each Bundle there are some reusable services that you
may inject directly in your app. As a generic pattern there are a 
couple of `*Manager` services, that provide related actions. So, for example in `CartManager`
you will find helpers like `getCart`, `createCartForUser` and `update`. The `update` service
returns a  `CartUpdateBuilder` where you can dynamically build update actions. To autowire
a service, for example `CatalogManager`, in a controller action, do the following: 

```php
<?php
namespace App\Controller;

use Commercetools\Symfony\CatalogBundle\Manager\CatalogManager;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

class MyController
{
    public function index(CatalogManager $manager)
    {
        /** @var CategoryCollection $categories */
        $categories = $manager->getCategories('en');

        return new Response(
            '<html><body>categories: '
            // handle CategoryCollection $categories
            .'</body></html>'
        );
    }
}
```

### Console Commands

`SetupBundle` and `StateBundle` come together with a few handy console commands. These commands
automate tasks during development and allow a 2-way sync between an online project and a local configuration.
To use a console command navigate to your project's directory and run

```sh
bin/console commercetools:<command-name>
```

#### Available console commands

- SetupBundle
    - `bin/console commercetools:project-info`: Fetches and displays information from commercetools platform
    about the selected project
    - `bin/console commercetools:project-apply-configuration`: Save the local project configuration that resides under
    `commercetools` key, on the online commercetools platform
    - `bin/console commercetools:create-custom-type`: Interactive CLI to create CustomTypes on your project
    - `bin/console commercetools:sync-custom-types-from-server`: Saves locally the CustomTypes currently present on the online project,
    in the `<PROJECT_DIR>/config/packages/<ENV>/custom_types.yaml` file
    - `bin/console commercetools:sync-custom-types-from-local`: Saves or updates the CustomTypes present locally in 
    the `<PROJECT_DIR>/config/packages/<ENV>/custom_types.yaml` file, on your online commercetools project
    
- StateBundle
    - `bin/console commercetools:set-state-machine-config`: Fetches States from commercetools platform and creates a 
    Symfony `state_machine` type configuration file at 
    `<PROJECT_DIR>/config/packages/<ENV>/workflow.yaml`
    - `bin/console commercetools:set-workflow-config`: Fetches States from commercetools platform and creates a Symfony
    `workflow` type configuration file at `<PROJECT_DIR>/config/packages/<ENV>/workflow.yaml`
    
      More info on working with Symfony Workflows can be found in Symfony's [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/workflow/usage.html):

### Using SDK Models in twig templates

If you are using Twig for your templating engine you can print the value of a nested attribute of any 
[SDK Model](https://commercetools.github.io/commercetools-php-sdk/docs/master/namespace-Commercetools.Core.Model.html)
just by referring the attribute's path and name. For example the following two are valid representations:
```
{{ product.masterVariant.attributes.test.value }}
{{ attribute(product.masterVariant.attributes, 'custom-attribute').value }}
```

## Disclaimer for ExampleBundle (dev)

There is an ExampleBundle provided in the repository which tries to demonstrate a sample
eshop implementation making use of the other Bundles provided. This ExampleBundle is currently 
under development. It may includes outdated code, is not properly tested and right now
is not encouraged to be used in any production environment. For now, we don't guarantee any
non breaking changes. We intend to fix the problems, improve it and create a more helpful 
generic example.

## Testing

Clone the project and navigate on the project's directory. On the command line, run
```sh
composer install --dev
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
